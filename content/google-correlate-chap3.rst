Chapter 3 - Google Correlate example update
===========================================

:date: 2020-07-11

In Chapter 3 on Page 87, the book refers to the Google Correlate service. However, as of December 2019, the service has been shutdown. 
Since the chapter requires you to download a CSV formatted data, it is no longer possible. However, you can instead download a version of 
the data that I had used 5 years back when writing the book from 
`here < https://github.com/doingmathwithpython/code/blob/master/chapter3/solutions/correlate-summer.csv>`__.

Thanks to a reader for pointing me to this issue.
